# Advent of Code 2023
This repo contains solutions for the [Advent of Code for 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

# Setting up Input Data
All input data should be placed under the folder `data/inputs/DayX.txt`.
For example, Day 1 data should be in the file: `data/inputs/Day1.txt`; please follow the same format for all other files.
These should be a direct copy-and-paste from the [Advent of Code data](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1/input) for that specific day.
